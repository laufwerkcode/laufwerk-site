Welcome to **laufwerk**. My name is Christian Benstein and I write about macOS based workflows, Obsidian and Things3. Follow my journey through tech. My philosophy is that your mind was not created to store information, but to act on it and create. We have great tools at our disposal, it's up to you to use them. One of my favorite analogies to this is "The computer should be a [bicycle ðŸš² for your mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L40B08nWoMk)".

**Some info about this blog**

- I use Categories and Tags to group my posts, this was inspired by [The Difference Between Good and Bad Tags](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/object-tags-vs-topic-tags/))
  - Categories are groups of posts under a specific topic, like Productivity or Jekyll. I use them like I would use tags to group under a topic.
  - Tags are used to group posts around an object, real or conceptual.
- I also recently started sharing some of my [study notes on the RedHat Exam 280](https://laufwerk.xyz/posts/creating-a-ex280-page/#why).
- Links to products I talk about might net me some money through referrals
- I use LLM's (also referred to as generative AI) to enhance my writing and assist me with voice to text
- Any questions? Talk `.md` to me over at [GitHub](https://github.com/laufwerkcode)
