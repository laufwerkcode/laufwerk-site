First off, you can read how and why I created this page in [this blog](/posts/creating-a-ex280-page/).

This page contains an overview of posts relating to [EX280 (Red Hat Certified Specialist in OpenShift Administration)](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex280-red-hat-certified-specialist-in-openshift-administration-exam?section=Overview). I'll also list some Study Resources and General Tips for taking the EX280 exam. I passed this exam on my second try (first try: 150/300, second try: 262/300).

# Study Resources.
I studied using the following resource and recommend them in the following order:

1. Sander van Vugt's great EX280 video course at [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/red-hat-openshift/9780137441938/)
2. I got some in depth knowledge from the book ["OpenShift in action"](https://www.manning.com/books/openshift-in-action)
3. CloudGuru has a great [practice exam available](https://acloudguru.com/hands-on-labs/ex280-practice-exam ). I also tried there study material but found it to be outdated, inaccurate and very shallow.

I also would like to give a shout out to the book ["Kubernetes: Up and Running"](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/kubernetes-up-and/9781492046523/). I read this book before I started my OpenShift journey. It's a great way to get familiar with different Kubernetes concepts and packs a lot of knowledge in less then 300 pages.

# General Tips
Here are some general tips when studying and taking the exam:
1. Setup CRC (Code Ready Containers) to do labs in, See [Red Hat CodeReady Containers](https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-containers/overview);
2. Practice, practice, practice the study labs and practice exams from [Sander van Vugt's study course](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/red-hat-openshift/9780137441938/)
3. Take extra care when reading the assignments and objectives during the exam. Try to copy paste all names and passwords and doublechek your work
4. Practice, practice and practice.

My hope is that you get something from this because I found EX280 to be quite challenging.

**Note**: When you enter the EX280 (or any RedHat exam) you also enter in to a NDA regarding the testing material. If you have any questions about the content of the exam I cannot help or comment on it. These posts are written to correspond to the exam objectives that are mentions on: [EX280 Exam Objectives](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex280-red-hat-certified-specialist-in-openshift-administration-exam?section=Objectives)
