# Supernote Templates

I use (and love) the [Supernote A6X2](https://supernote.com/pages/supernote-nomad) to write on. I made some templates for it:

- [Monthly Habit Tracker](/assets/templates/Custom%20Habit%20Tracker%20w%20Notes.png) with room for notes
- [Monthly Habit Tracker](/assets/templates/Custom%20Habit%20Tracker%20w%20Week%20and%20Notes.png) with room for notes and a weekly habit tracker
- [Monthly Habit Tracker](/assets/templates/Custom%20Habit%20Tracker%20w%20Week%20and%20Month%20as%20Circles.png) with room for a monthly and a weekly habit tracker

# Recommendation

I use some fun stuff. Here is a list of random things I recommend:

- [HMF 6810 Wheels for desk chairs](https://amzn.to/4e8xCp4) are the wheels your chair and floor deserve. These will upgrade your chair for a small cost. Think of these as the same wheels you would find under in-line skates. The main upside is that they roll smoother over hard floor and carpet and that you don't need to use a floor protector to protect the floor from plastic hard wheels. Make sure you get the right diameter for your deckchair!
- The [JetDrive Lite 330](https://amzn.to/47hmkMP) is a mini SD card you can
leave in your MacBook. The advantages? Non-stop TimeMachine backups! I have one
of these permanently in every MacBook is use to always backup my files.
